## PS2-HLTE-BETA

- The ability to extract .bmp files from the .dol file.
- exports all textures with correct names.
- Currently only works for gman.dol (working on making a window/program version)

Extracting the gman model from the DOL file found inside the PAK archive within the ISO of the PS2 file.
More on it [here](https://www.moddb.com/members/jolly-joe/blogs/jolly-devlog-half-life-decay-ps2-models).

UPDATE!

dol_png.py -> python program that views the PS2 .dol file and lets the user extract one or all of the textures in a 8-bit color format that works with Half Life Asset Manager.
